# Classical Modern English Translator

A sophisticated web application that transforms modern English text into classical, elegant language reminiscent of Shakespearean era. Watch as your contemporary sentences become refined, formal expressions through intelligent pattern-based transformations.

## Features

- **Classical Language Transformation**: Convert modern text to elegant classical English
- **Intelligent Pattern Matching**: Uses sophisticated word replacement and phrase enhancement
- **Translation Journey**: Track how your text evolves through the transformation process
- **Beautiful Dark UI**: Modern interface with purple accents and smooth animations
- **Copy Functionality**: Easily copy and share your classical transformations
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works seamlessly across all devices
- **Real-time Processing**: Instant transformations with no external API dependencies

## How It Works

1. **Input**: Enter any modern English text or phrase
2. **Transformation**: The text undergoes classical English pattern matching
3. **Result**: Receive your elegantly transformed classical English text
4. **Share**: Copy and share your refined classical expressions

### Example:
- **Input**: "I love this weather today"
- **Transformation Process**: Modern English â†’ Classical English
- **Output**: "Verily, thou dost love this weather today, if it please thee"

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React** with TypeScript
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations
- **React Hot Toast** for notifications
- **CSS3** with dark theme and responsive design

### Backend
- **Node.js** with Express
- **Pattern-based transformation engine** (no external APIs)
- **Local processing** for instant results
- **CORS** enabled for cross-origin requests

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Quick Start

1. **Clone or navigate to the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd "Meme translator"
   ```

2. **Start the backend server**
   ```bash
   cd server
   node index.js
   ```

3. **Start the frontend (in a new terminal)**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

This will start both servers:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:5000

## Usage

1. **Enter Your Text**: Type any modern English sentence or phrase
2. **Begin Transformation**: Click the transformation button to start the classical conversion
3. **View Results**: See your text elegantly transformed into classical English
4. **Copy & Share**: Copy your refined classical text for use elsewhere

## Customization

### Adding More Classical Patterns

Edit `server/routes/translate.js` to enhance the transformation patterns:

```javascript
const CLASSICAL_TRANSFORMATIONS = {
  words: {
    'you': 'thou',
    'your': 'thy',
    // Add more word transformations here
  }
};
```

### Styling

The app uses CSS files located in:
- `client/src/App.css` - Main app styles with dark theme
- `client/src/components/` - Individual component styles
